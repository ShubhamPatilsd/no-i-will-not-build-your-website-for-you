# No, I Will _NOT_ Build Your [**\_\_**] For You

All too often I will get someone asking me:

> "Hey, I see that you're into coding. Can you build my website for me?"

## Why Not?

I used to say yes to these request a lot, before I quickly got fed up with how monotonous the work is. I lost a lot of time, which I would have used for projects that I truly cared about and that I really had an interest in, and I quickly started loathing the process of making an app or website.

Unless you love hating your work and spending hours on something that you don't want to work on, I would _highly_ suggest that you do **_NOT_** accept these offers. Unless they offer really good compensation for your time, it is just not worth it.

## Compensation

The talk about compensation brings me to my second point. If you still want to build something for someone, please do **_not_** accept offers without compensation. I have made this mistake as a beginner, which involved me underestimating my self-worth. Monetary compensation is the only options that is worthwhile. Getting to be part of the "organization" that they want you to build an app/website for is not a substitute for actual money.

I have seen many people thinking they can squeeze a website out of me for free, and this is simply not how you and I should go about things. Once you even _talk_ about money, you can filter out the jobs that are worthwhile and the ones that aren't.

Here are a couple of rules for deciding how much compensation you should get:

- First of all, set an hourly rate, not a flat rate
- Estimate how long the job will take, and then multiply that by x1.5
- Then, decide an hourly rate for your work. Don't undersell yourself, you are amazing. A good rate is about $45 hour for an intensive job.

Here is an example of a job you shouldn't take:

Here, there are a couple of things that are wrong:

- No compensation defined, it's all about "when it becomes successful."
- This "learning experience" is something that you will anyways get with a job that will pay you.

If there is no direct compensation defined (e.g. there is not going to be a fixed amount of money going to your bank account), I will highly recommend that you quit the work; it is not worth your time.

## Conclusion

So there you have it. Please tread with caution; you are much more than you make yourself out to be. Value your skills and don't get tangled up with scams and whatnot. Do what you love, not what others want you to do. And if someone ever asks you to build their website (or for free), simply say "no."
